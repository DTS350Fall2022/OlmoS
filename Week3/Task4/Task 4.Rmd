Have the rates of Covid tests gone down since the vaccine was administered?

Have the rates of hospitalization due to covid gone down since the covid vaccine was administered?

How many jobs have been affected by the covid pandemic, going remote, hybrid, fully in person?

I received feedback from 6 people and each of them were interested in the two questions I posed. One specific piece of feedback was that my second question was not specific enough at first so I made a modification to it by adding the three different job types.
