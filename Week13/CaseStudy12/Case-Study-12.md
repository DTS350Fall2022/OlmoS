I chose to to use the cities that are on the coast for the last plot. To me it makes sense that the coastal cities would sell avocados for a somewhat lower price with the best quality because of the increasing availability compared to inland cities. Through this I would advise my friend to look for jobs in Los Angeles or Portland because it seems like the avocados are sold at a higher volume for a lower average price. We can see that the average prices for avocados are highest in San Francisco and Tampa, so I would not advise my friend to look for a job in those cities unless absolutely necessary.
